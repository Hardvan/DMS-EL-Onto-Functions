# Codebase for DMS EL 3rd Semester

## Problem Statement

### Calculate the number of onto functions from a set S to a set T, where S and T are finite sets of various sizes. List all of them.

## Usage

### The problem statement requires calculating the number and listing all onto functions from S to T, where S and T are finite sets of various sizes. An onto function is a function that maps every element in S to at least one element in T.

## Dependencies

### The code requires the itertools module, which is a built-in Python module.
